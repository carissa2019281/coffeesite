<h4>FLAVOR PROFILE</h4>
"Sweet, red fruit, some tropical. Very slight leather seems to be common. Medium quality acidity." –Michael Mac Donald, Medium
<h4>ABOUT</h4>
"Typically wet processed (washed), a fine New Guinea coffee is deeply dimensioned yet well-balanced, with mild and mellow yet broad flavors that provide a bright and clean taste - a classic, delicate sweetness complemented by an exotic, complex and fruity aroma. The region produces coffees with lots of oils, which come out as early as a medium roast and offer a full body that is consistent with many Indonesian coffees. This makes it ideal in a french press or steel-filter drip coffee maker which allows the natural oils and flavors to shine." –Espresso Coffee Guide
